We unfortunately weren’t able to finish two of the seven articles submitted to Issue Six in time for publication — look out for them in future issues of Code Words!

With seven articles, Issue Six will be the biggest issue of Code Words yet, featuring writing from Sal Becker (RC Fall 2, 2015), Miles Blackwood (RC Fall 2, 2015), Sher Minn Chong (RC Fall 1, 2015), Patrick Dubroy (RC resident), Liz Sander (RC Summer 2, 2015) , Anjana Vakil (RC Fall 2, 2015),  and Nat Welch (RC Spring 2, 2015). In addition to all of the writers, we’d like to thank Barak Chamo (RC Fall 1, 2015), Timnit Gebru (RC Summer 2012), Robert Lord (RC Winter 2014), Alan O'Donnell (facilitator emeritus and RC Summer 2011), Oskar Thorén (RC Fall 2012), and Alex Wilson (RC Summer 2013) for all their careful editing and help.
