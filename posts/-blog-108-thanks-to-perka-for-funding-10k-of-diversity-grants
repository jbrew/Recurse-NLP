We’d like to thank Perka for sponsoring $10,000 in Recurse Center diversity grants, and enabling more wonderful programmers to spend a batch at RC.

Perka has been a Recurse Center hiring partner since 2013, and this is the second round of grants they’ve provided for Recursers.

The Recurse Center remains free for everyone; we offer grants of $500 - $7,000 to folks from groups that are underrepresented in programming to help cover living expenses.Since 2012 we’ve disbursed over $1 million in grants to Recursers, and diversity at the Recurse Center has improved dramatically.

If you’d like to join the best community of programmers in the world, apply to do a batch of RC.
