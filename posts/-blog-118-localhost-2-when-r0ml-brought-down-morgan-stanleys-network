We’re excited to announce our second Localhost talk. Localhost is a series of monthly, NYC-based, free public technical talks from members of the Recurse Center community.

Our speaker will be former RC resident r0ml, who will be giving a talk on September 26th from 7 pm - 9 pm at Etsy, about how he brought down Morgan Stanley’s network in 1984.

You can RSVP, read the abstract, and find more details about the venue and schedule on the talk’s RSVP page.

Localhost talks are 20–30 minutes long, and are followed by a dedicated Q&A session. There will be a two-minute break after the talk for folks who wish to leave. There are a few reasons we run talks this way:

Unlike most RC events, Localhost talks are open to the public! We’re setting aside a fixed number of seats for folks who aren’t members of our community at every talk. This is new for us, and we’re excited to get to meet more programmers at our events.

We know that attending a batch of RC requires a large time commitment, and hope that Localhost talks will be a great way for people to get a taste of what the RC community is like (and maybe even apply for a batch afterwards!). If you RSVP, please read about our social rules before the event.

We currently have three more talks planned for this year:

We’ll open RSVPs and post details for future talks on our Localhost page and here on our blog. Follow us here and on Twitter for updates on when RSVPs open for future talks!

All guests of Recurse Center events are required to abide by our
code of conduct.
