Ever since we moved to overlapping batches, we’ve had a problem with our batch names. With
eight batches a year, Summer, Fall, and Winter no longer make sense. For
a while we’ve been avoiding the problem by embedding dates directly into the
batch names, but that wasn’t an elegant solution.

Today we’re introducing new batch names. Batches will be named with a season,
the number 1 or 2, and a year. For example, the batch starting on October 6th
of this year is called Fall 2, 2014. Here is a full list of batch names for
2015:

It’s not a typo that Winter 2 comes before Winter 1. While it is confusing,
we think the alternative isn’t much better: Winter 2, 2014 would be followed
by Winter 1, 2015. We wish there was a perfect solution, but we feel a bit
better knowing that naming is one of the two hard problems in Computer
Science.1

Batch names can be abbreviated with the first letter of the season (e.g.
F2'14). In the interest of disambiguation, the abbreviations for Spring and
Summer use the first two letters of the season (Sp1'15 and Su2'16).

We’ve added the new batch names to our FAQ, apply page and the rest of our site.  We’ve
also retroactively applied the new names to all existing overlapping batches.
If you find a place where we’re still using old batch names, please let us
know.
