This is part of our “Paper of the Week” series. For more info, check out our
introductory blog post.

This week’s paper is Error Detecting and Error Correcting
Codes by Richard
Hamming. It was published in
the April 1950 issue of the Bell System Technical
Journal. Hamming
worked at Bell Labs from 1946 to 1976. During those years, the transistor,
information theory, modern cryptography, the solar cell, the laser, UNIX, C,
and the error correcting codes described in this paper were all invented at
Bell Labs.

Hacker School alum Dan Luu submitted this paper and said
the following:

Despite being more than six decades old, Hamming codes are probably the most
commonly used error-correcting codes (ECC) today, and I’ve probably
used/implemented them more often than all other types of ECC combined. They’re
one of the first things you should consider if you’re sending/storing data in a
lossy medium and you need ECC that’s simple/fast, or if you’re operating on
small chunks of data.

Also, I believe this is the second paper written on error
correcting codes, and that it’s often considered to be the seminal
work in the field. Because the field was so young at the time, the
paper assumes no background, which makes it eminently readable.

Read Along is a way for you to participate in Paper of the Week. If you want
to take part, all you have to do is read the paper, make something small in
response (code or prose), email us a link of what you make by
noon Eastern Time next Monday, and we’ll link to it from our blog.

Nobody submitted a Read Along this week, so there’s nothing to post here. If
you are reading along with us, please don’t be shy! Even a one paragraph
Gist with your unedited thoughts would be fun for
other people to read.

Happy reading!
