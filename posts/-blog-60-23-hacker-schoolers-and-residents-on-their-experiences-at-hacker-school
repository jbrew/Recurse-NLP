One of the best ways to get a sense of what Hacker School is actually like is to read first-hand accounts of people who have done it. Fortunately, many alumni and residents have blogged about their experiences at Hacker School. Unfortunately, these posts are scattered across the web and can be hard to find. Weâ€™ve collected many of these blog posts here.

The posts below were written by current Hacker Schoolers or alumni, either during or after their batches. This is just a sampling of the posts folks have written about their experiences at Hacker School, and is presented in no particular order and in no way intended to be comprehensive.

The posts below were written by residents, who visit Hacker School in one- or two-week stints.
