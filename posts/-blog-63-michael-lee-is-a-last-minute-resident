We’re excited to have Michael Lee in residency at
Hacker School this week!

Michael is a fifth year Ph.D. student at UT Austin studying security and
operating systems. He works on improving and changing the security properties
of commodity operating systems and research into creating practical crypto
protocols and systems. He has also collaborated with researchers at Columbia
University and Sandia National Labs.

Michael has already given a seminar on
Anon-Pass, an anonymous
subscription system, and is in the middle of giving another on the guts of the
Linux kernel with an eye towards security.

If you want to program with residents like Michael, you should apply to Hacker School. We’ll be announcing more
residents in the next few weeks.
