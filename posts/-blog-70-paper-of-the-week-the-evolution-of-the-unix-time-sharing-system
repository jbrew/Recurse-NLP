This is part of our “Paper of the Week” series. For more info, check out our
introductory blog post.

This week’s paper is The Evolution of the Unix Time-sharing
System by Dennis
Ritchie. It was presented at the 1979
Language Design and Programming Methodology conference in Sydney, Australia.

This paper describes the early history of Unix, which was created in 1969. It’s
fun to see what’s been the same since the beginning (IO redirection), what’s
changed (there weren’t any path names!), and how things got to be the way they
are today. As supplemental reading, you may also enjoy Ritchie’s short writeup
of Space Travel, the game
for the PDP-7 that preceded Unix. If you’re feeling ambitious this weekend,
building a modern version of Space Travel might be a fun exercise (and a great
Read Along submission).

The Evolution of the Unix Time-sharing System was recommended by Hacker School resident Michael Lee.

Here’s the abstract:

This paper presents a brief history of the early development of the Unix
operating system. It concentrates on the evolution of the file system, the
process-control mechanism, and the idea of pipelined commands. Some attention
is paid to social conditions during the development of the system.

Read Along is a way for you to participate in Paper of the Week. All you have
to do is read the paper, make something small in response (code or prose), and
email us
a link to what you made by noon Eastern Time next Monday.

Hacker School alum Oskar Thorén submitted a tweet that he claims gets close to the essence of Error Detecting and Error Correcting Codes. Thanks Oskar!

Happy reading!
