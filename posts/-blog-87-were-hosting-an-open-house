We do our best to share what makes the environment at the Recurse Center special on our blog, our mailing list and our Twitter. But we realize that the experience of attending RC is hard to put in to words, so we’re hosting our first open house on Wednesday, July 29th from 7 pm - 9 pm.

We’re hoping this event gets you excited to apply for a batch, whether you’ve never considered applying before or if you have been thinking about it for years.

The open house will begin with a short welcome talk, followed by presentations from current and past Recursers about what they’ve been working on, and a Q&A session. Food and drinks will be served.

If you’d like to attend the open house, RSVP no later than this Friday, July 24th. Please note that space is limited, and we may need to close RSVPs.
