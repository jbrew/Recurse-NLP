Last year we hosted two open houses at our space in New York City, and were grateful to get the chance to share what the Recurse Center is like with so many new folks. We’d like to do the same for programmers who live in San Francisco and couldn’t make it out to New York City for our past events.

On Friday, February 19th from 2:30 pm - 4:30 pm we’ll be hosting an info session at Stripe’s offices in San Francisco for folks on the west coast who would like to learn more about RC. While you won’t be able to visit the RC space, you’ll have the chance to meet alumni, see some projects they worked on during their batches, and ask us lots of questions.

The session will begin with a short welcome talk, followed by presentations from current and past Recursers about what they’ve been working on, and a Q&A session. Food and drinks will be served. 

Once you RSVP, we’ll send you more details about the timing of the event and the location. Special thanks to Stripe for hosting us and for providing lunch.

We’re hoping the open house gets you excited to apply for a batch, whether you’ve never considered applying before or if you have been thinking about it for years.

If you’d like to attend, RSVP no later than Monday, February 15th. Please note that space is limited, and we may need to close RSVPs.
