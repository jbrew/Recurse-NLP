We’re excited to announce Localhost, a monthly NYC-based series of free public technical talks from members of the Recurse Center community.

Our first speaker will be RC alum Dan Luu, who will be giving a talk about branch prediction on August 22nd from 7 pm - 9 pm at the Two Sigma Ventures offices.

You can RSVP, read the abstract, and find more details about the venue and timing on the talk’s RSVP page.

Localhost talks will be 20–30 minutes long, and will be followed by a dedicated Q&A session. There will be a two-minute break after the talk if folks wish to leave. There are a few reasons we run talks this way:

Unlike most RC events, Localhost talks will be open to the public! We’re setting aside fixed numbers of seats for folks who aren’t members of our community at every talk. This is a first for us, and we’re excited to get to meet more programmers at our events. 

We know that attending a batch of RC requires a large time commitment, and hope that Localhost talks will be a great way for people to get a taste of what the RC community is like (and maybe even apply for a batch afterwards!). If you RSVP, please read about our social rules before the event.

When possible we’ll stream and record these talks for folks who can’t make it to them and alums who are outside of NYC. We’ll post confirmation of whether or not we’re streaming a talk and a link to the stream on the Localhost page.

We currently have three more talks planned for this year:

We’ll open RSVPs and post details for future talks on our Localhost page and here on our blog. Follow us here and on Twitter for updates on when RSVPs open for future talks!
