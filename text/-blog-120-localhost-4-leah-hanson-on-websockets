We’re excited to announce our fourth Localhost talk! Localhost is a series of monthly, NYC-based, free public technical talks from members of the Recurse Center community.

Our speaker is Leah Hanson, an RC alum who will be giving a talk on November 14th from 7:00 pm–9:00 pm at Dropbox about WebSockets.

You can RSVP, read the abstract, and find more details about the venue and schedule on the talk’s RSVP page.

Localhost talks are 20–30 minutes long, and are followed by a dedicated Q&A session. There will be a two-minute break after the talk for folks who wish to leave. There are a few reasons we run talks this way:

Unlike most RC events, Localhost talks are open to the public! We’re setting aside a fixed number of seats for folks who aren’t members of our community at every talk. It’s been great meeting so many new folks at our Localhost talks!

We know that attending a batch of RC requires a large time commitment, and hope that Localhost talks will be a great way for people to get a taste of what the RC community is like (and maybe even apply for a batch afterwards!). If you RSVP, please read about our social rules before the event.

We currently have one more talk planned for this year (David Nolen will be speaking on December 12th), and are working on a schedule for 2018!

We’ll open RSVPs and post details for future talks on our Localhost page and here on our blog. Follow us here and on Twitter for updates on when RSVPs open for future talks!

All guests of Recurse Center events are required to abide by our
code of conduct.
