RSVPs for our next Localhost talk are now open. Localhost is a series of monthly, NYC-based, free, public technical talks from members of the Recurse Center community.

On July 24th from 7:00 to 9:00 pm, RC alumna Bonnie Eisenman will be giving a talk about caching data and cheating the CAP Theorem with dynamically scaled TTLs. The talk will be hosted at AppNexus, our Localhost partner through the rest of 2018.

You can RSVP, read the abstract, and find more details about the venue and schedule on the talk’s RSVP page.

Localhost talks are 30 minutes long, and are followed by a dedicated Q&A session. There will be a two-minute break after the talk for folks who wish to leave. There are a few reasons we run talks this way:

Unlike most RC events, Localhost talks are open to the public. We set aside a fixed number of seats for folks who aren’t members of our community at every talk. It’s been great meeting so many new folks at our Localhost talks!

We know that attending a batch of RC is a big commitment, and hope that Localhost talks are a way for people to get a taste of what the RC community is like (and maybe even apply for a batch afterwards!). If you RSVP, please read about our social rules before the event.

We’ll open RSVPs and post details for future talks on our Localhost page and here on our blog. Follow us here and on Twitter for updates on when RSVPs open.

All guests of Recurse Center events are required to abide by our
code of conduct.
