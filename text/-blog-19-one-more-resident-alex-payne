We have one more resident to announce for the summer 2013 batch: Alex Payne. Alex co-authored O'Reilly’s Programming Scala, was one of the first programmers at Twitter, and most recently served for two years as CTO of Simple.

Alex was in our first group of residents in the fall batch last year.  He embodies what we look for in residents: he’s talented, accomplished, and knowledgeable, but also humble, unassuming, and incredibly friendly. We’re delighted to welcome him back this summer.
