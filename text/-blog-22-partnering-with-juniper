I’m excited to announce that we’ve partnered with Juniper Networks.

Juniper has been a wonderful supporter of Hacker School: They’ve both sponsored our summer 2013 batch and provided 20 $5,000 grants for female programmers. Although Hacker School is free for all students, living in New York for three months is most certainly not, and these grants made a huge difference for a number of women who would otherwise have been unable to attend Hacker School.

Throughout our work together, Juniper has proven itself to care deeply about supporting programmers, and increasing the number of female developers in particular. This support helped make our summer 2013 batch our largest yet with 70 students.

This batch has also been one of our most diverse: we welcomed robotics and statistics Ph.D’s, a former professional ballet dancer, a 20-year veteran of Wall Street, our first high school student, and bright and experienced engineers from some of the world’s top startups and tech companies. Seventy-five percent of our students came from outside of New York, 15% came from outside of the country, and 30% were female.

Hacker School works best with such a diverse student body. Our model is based in large part on people coming together from a range of backgrounds and experience levels, and helping each grow as programmers. Juniper’s support this summer has helped make this possible.

Thank you, Juniper!
