We’re excited to announce that Google is sponsoring over $150,000 of need-based
grants for female programmers to come to Hacker School. These grants will allow
us to provide financial assistance for living expenses to women for our
upcoming batch and hopefully beyond. (Tuition, of course, remains free for
everyone; the grants are only for living expenses for those in financial
need.1)

This is the largest sponsorship of grants we’ve ever received, and we’re
incredibly thankful for Google’s support. For nearly two years, we’ve worked to
secure grants for female programmers who cannot afford to live without an
income during Hacker School. Getting enough grants has been (and remains)
a challenging and time-consuming process. In addition to helping make Hacker
School bigger and better, Google’s generous support will give us a bit of
breathing room over the next months, and allow us to spend even more time on
improving other parts of Hacker School.

Thank you, Google!
