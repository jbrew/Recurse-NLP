Applications are now open for the Spring 2, 2015 batch of Hacker School, which runs from March 30th through July 2nd. There are also plenty of spots left in the Winter 1, Winter 2, and Spring 1 batches. You can see the dates for these batches in our FAQ. The application deadline for Spring 2 is March 9th, 2015, but admissions are rolling, so the earlier you apply, the better.

Hacker School is free for everyone, but we know that living in NYC can be expensive. We offer need based grants to cover living expenses for people who identify as women (cis or trans), black, Latino/a, Native American, and/or Pacific Islander.

If you’re interested in applying to Hacker School, we strongly encourage you to read our about page, FAQ and User’s Manual.
