This is the last post in our “Paper of the Week” series. For more info, check
out the introductory blog post.

We’ve decided to stop publishing Paper of the Week. Paper of the Week has
been fun to write, but we don’t think it’s worth continuing given the limited
response we’ve gotten and the amount of time it takes to put together. Instead,
we’re going to focus on writing other things for our blog1.

For posterity (and because our blog doesn’t have categories), here are links
to all past Papers of the Week collected in one place.

Thanks to everyone who submitted a paper, a Read Along, a suggestion, or a
comment. We hope that Paper of the Week has been enjoyable, and maybe even a
bit enlightening.

Happy reading!
