When we announced our residency program last month, we didn’t know what type of response we’d get. Would it be possible to get prominent progammers to take time away from their normal lives and jobs and spend a couple weeks at Hacker School?

We’re happy to say we now know the answer: Yes, it’s possible. And we’re even happier to announce our first set of Residents: Alex Payne, Peter Seibel, Jessica McKellar, David Nolen, and Stefan Karpinski. You can read all about them on our Residents page.

We’re thrilled to have such a wonderful group of Residents for our fall batch. They are all phenomenally smart and warm people, with significant expertise and passion, and are genuinely interested in helping others become better programmers.

If you’d like to hack with the creator of Julia, or write Scala with the guy who wrote the book on it, or start contributing to Twisted with its maintainer, or if you simply want to grow as a programmer in a friendly, supportive, and open environment, you should apply to Hacker School.
