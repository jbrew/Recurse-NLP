Update on January 4th, 2016: All of the pieces from Issue Five are now live! Check out Lauren Long’s explanation of what RESTful means and Julia Evans’ work on fooling neural networks.

The first piece from Issue Five of Code Words, our quarterly publication about programming, is now online!

As with Issue Four, we’re publishing Issue Five piece-by-piece. You can read more about the reasons why in our Issue Four announcement blog post from October.

The first piece is a guide to writing web applications in Elixir with Plug by Robert Lord (RC Winter 2014).

The issue will also include writing from Lauren Long (RC Fall 2, 2015) and Julia Evans (RC Fall 2013). In addition to all of the writers, we’d like to thank Aditya Mukerjee (RC Spring 1, 2015), Oskar Thorén (RC Fall 2012), Stephen Tu (former RC resident), Anjana Vakil (RC Fall 2, 2015) and Alex Wilson (RC Summer 2013) for all their careful editing and help. Special thanks to Dan Luu, Leah Hanson, and Victor Felder for their feedback. New pieces from Issue Five will be published throughout next week, so make sure to check back often!
